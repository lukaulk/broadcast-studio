# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sexual characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual orientation and identity.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment for our community include:

- Showing empathy and kindness to other people
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Gracefully accepting and offering constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the entire community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing private information about others, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing acceptable behavior standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate the reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and also when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representation include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a designated representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement via our Discord server. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and safety of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines to determine the consequences of any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior considered unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity on the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
